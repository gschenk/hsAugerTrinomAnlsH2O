===trinomial Auger Analsis===

The script in this repository uses trinomial
combination to calculate form single particle
transition probabilities transfer probabilities
to inclusive final charge states in the
lithium-ion--water collision system.

This repository re-traces the development steps
of a haskell script written for the Auger trinomial
analysis for Li^{3+}--H_2O collisions in
Phys Rev A 93 052705.

The scrips was developed in a (non-public) repository
along with text, data, results and figures. 
(see /data/gschenk/Latex/intgno on tk1 or
git@github.com:gschenk/intgno.git)
The script begins with commit
ce7ff5bde8eee656cc5eb11d9e23c2e4f2d4ecb2,
major revisions are traced here, while smaller
changes, that are asides to commits to text or data
are implicitly added through their differences in
the larger commits.
