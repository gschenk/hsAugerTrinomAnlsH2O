# Trinomial Auger Analsis

The script in this repository implements trinomial
combination to calculate electron transfer probabilities
for water molecule. Secondary ionization due to Auger
processes is considered with the approach of
[Tobias Spranger and Tom Kirchner 2004 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 37 4159](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/37/20/010).

This repository re-traces the development steps
of a Haskell script written for the Auger trinomial
analysis for Li^{3+}--H_2O collisions. The results
were published in
[Luna et al Phys Rev A 93 052705](http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.052705)
([full text, research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303095074_Ionization_and_electron-capture_cross_sections_for_single-_and_multiple-electron_removal_from_H_2_O_by_Li_3_impact)).

The scrips was developed in a (non-public) repository
along with text, data, results and figures. 
(see /data/gschenk/Latex/intgno on tk1 or
git@github.com:gschenk/intgno.git).
The script begins with commit
ce7ff5bde8eee656cc5eb11d9e23c2e4f2d4ecb2,
major revisions are traced here, while smaller
changes, that are asides to commits to text or data
are implicitly added through their differences in
the larger commits.
